**Tweet 1/10** (Hook)
🚨 I built the first LLM benchmark that can't be faked.

Instead of static tests (which might be in training data), I test models on events that haven't happened yet.

7 frontier LLMs are now predicting the future with real money. Here's how it works: 🧵

**Tweet 2/10** (The Problem)
Traditional benchmarks have a fatal flaw:

The answers might already be in the training data.

When GPT-5 scores 95% on MMLU, is that genuine reasoning or memorization?

We can't tell. That's a problem.

---

**Tweet 3/10** (The Solution)
Forecaster Arena solves this with a simple insight:

Test models on *future events* that literally cannot exist in any training data.

How? Real prediction markets from @Polymarket

Bitcoin price in March? Academy Awards? Economic indicators? Models must forecast, then reality judges.

**Tweet 4/10** (The Setup)
Every Sunday, 7 frontier LLMs compete:
• GPT-5.1 (@OpenAI)
• Claude Opus 4.5 (@AnthropicAI)
• Gemini 2.5 Flash (@Google)
• Grok 4 (@xAI)
• DeepSeek V3.1
• Kimi K2
• Qwen 3 Next

Each gets $10,000 virtual capital and 500+ real markets.

---

**Tweet 5/10** (How It Works)
Models express confidence through bet sizing:
• $2,500 bet (25% max) = Very confident
• $500 bet = Moderately confident
• $50 bet = Uncertain but leaning

We track TWO metrics:
1. Calibration (Brier Score) - how accurate
2. Returns (P/L) - can they generate value

Both matter.

**Tweet 6/10** (Current Status)
Launched Dec 7th. First cohort running now:

📊 666 markets tracked
📈 526 currently active
🎯 20 open positions
💭 32 decisions logged

Early observations:
• Claude Opus 4.5: Most active (6 positions)
• DeepSeek & GPT-5.1: Conservative
• Kimi K2: Observing (0 positions)

---

**Tweet 7/10** (Why This Matters)
This is the first benchmark where:

✓ No contamination possible (future events)
✓ Objective truth (markets resolve themselves)
✓ Continuous renewal (new markets daily)
✓ Full transparency (every decision logged)
✓ Dual evaluation (accuracy + value)

Reality doesn't lie.

1. Pin the thread to your profile
2. Quote-tweet with screenshot after posting
3. Engage with all replies in first hour
4. Tag relevant accounts (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) in follow-up quote tweet, not main thread
5. Use 2-3 relevant hashtags max: #AI #LLM #MachineLearning

## 🔄 Alternative Short Version (5 tweets):

**1/5**:
I built an LLM benchmark that tests models on future events. 7 frontier AIs are now predicting the future with real Polymarket markets. Reality is the judge. 🧵

**2/5**:
GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 4, DeepSeek V3.1, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 Next—all competing with $10K each. They bet based on confidence. We measure calibration + returns.

**3/5**:
Why it matters: Traditional benchmarks risk data contamination. This tests genuine forecasting on events that haven't happened yet. First unfakeable LLM benchmark.

**4/5**:
Current: 666 markets, 20 positions, 32 decisions. First resolutions coming soon. Everything logged, fully open source. Built for research, not hype.

**5/5**:

Reality doesn't grade on a curve. Let's see which models can predict it. 🚀
