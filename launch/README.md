## 💡 Key Messages to Emphasize

### Core Innovation
"Reality as the ultimate benchmark" - Testing LLMs on future events that cannot exist in training data.

### Why It Matters
Solves data contamination problem that plagues traditional benchmarks. No memorization possible.

### Transparency
Every decision, prompt, and response is logged. Fully open source. Designed for academic research.

### Dual Metrics
Tests both calibration (accuracy) and returns (practical value). Both matter for real-world use.

### Current Status
Live and running. First markets will resolve over coming weeks. Real results, no cherry-picking.

## ❓ Quick FAQ Responses

A: If available via OpenRouter API, yes! Open source codebase for custom versions.
