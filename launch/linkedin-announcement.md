# Forecaster Arena - LinkedIn Launch Announcement

**🎯 TLDR**: I built a benchmark that tests LLMs on events that *haven't happened yet*—solving the data contamination problem by using reality itself as the judge.

**Introducing Forecaster Arena: The First Unfakeable LLM Benchmark**

Traditional AI benchmarks have a fatal flaw: the answers might already be in the training data. When GPT-5 scores 95% on a coding test, is that genuine reasoning or memorization?

I built Forecaster Arena to answer this question honestly.

**The Core Insight: Reality as the Ultimate Benchmark**

Instead of static test sets, I evaluate LLMs on real prediction markets from Polymarket—questions about future events that literally cannot exist in any training dataset.

- Will Bitcoin hit $150K by March?
- Who will win the 2025 Academy Awards?
- Will inflation drop below 2% this quarter?

The models must forecast real-world outcomes. The ground truth? Reality itself, weeks or months later.

**📸 [SCREENSHOT 1: Live leaderboard showing 7 frontier LLMs competing with current positions]**

**How It Works:**

Every Sunday, 7 frontier LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 4, DeepSeek V3.1, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 Next) receive:
- $10,000 virtual capital
- 500+ active prediction markets
- One week to decide: bet, sell, or hold

They express confidence through bet sizing. The system tracks two metrics:
1. **Calibration** (Brier Score) - Are they well-calibrated forecasters?
2. **Returns** (P/L) - Can predictions generate value?

**Why This Matters:**

✓ **No contamination** - Future events can't be in training data
✓ **Objective resolution** - Markets resolve based on real outcomes
✓ **Continuous renewal** - New markets created constantly
✓ **Dual metrics** - Tests both calibration AND practical value
✓ **Full transparency** - Every prompt, response, and trade logged

This isn't just another leaderboard. It's a fundamental rethinking of how we evaluate AI capabilities.

**Current Status:**

The system launched December 7th and is running its first cohort:
- **666 markets** tracked from Polymarket
- **526 active markets** currently tradeable
- **20 open positions** across 7 models
- **32 decisions** logged with full reasoning

Early patterns emerging:
- Claude Opus 4.5 took 6 positions (most active)
- DeepSeek V3.1 and GPT-5.1 taking more conservative approaches
- Kimi K2 staying on sidelines (all cash, observing)
- First market resolutions expected in coming weeks

Real results will emerge as markets resolve over the next few weeks and months. No pre-determined outcomes, no synthetic data—just models versus reality.

**📸 [SCREENSHOT 3: Live market view showing models' current positions or decision reasoning examples]**

**Open Source & Reproducible:**

The entire system is MIT licensed and publicly available:
- Complete methodology documentation
- Full source code
- Every decision and outcome logged
- Designed for peer-reviewed research

This is a research benchmark, not a production service. The goal: honest evaluation of LLM forecasting capabilities using the only test that can't be gamed—reality.

**What's Next:**

I'm looking for:
- Researchers interested in LLM forecasting capabilities
- Feedback on methodology improvements
- Collaboration on analysis and publications
- Ideas for additional evaluation dimensions

## 🎯 Alternative Hooks (choose based on your style):

### For AI Researchers:
"We've been measuring LLMs wrong. Here's a benchmark that tests genuine reasoning, not memorization."

### For Tech Community:
"I made 7 frontier LLMs compete at predicting the future with real money (well, virtual). First results rolling in."

### For Forecasting Community:
"Which AI is the best forecaster? I built a benchmark using real Polymarket data to find out. First cohort live now."

### For Academia:
"Introducing the first LLM benchmark immune to data contamination—using future events as test cases. Open source, fully reproducible."

## 💡 Engagement Tips:

1. **Timing**: Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM in your timezone
2. **Tags**: Consider tagging (@mention) relevant researchers if appropriate
3. **Hashtags**: Mix popular (#AI, #MachineLearning) with niche (#Forecasting, #PredictionMarkets)
4. **First 2 Hours**: Respond to all comments quickly to boost engagement
5. **Follow-up**: Plan weekly updates as markets resolve and data accumulates
6. **Cross-post**: Share on X/Twitter with a thread format
7. **Show Personality**: Share what surprised you, what you learned building it

## 🔄 Suggested Follow-Up Posts (weekly):

**Week 2**: "First markets resolving - here's what the models got right (and wrong)"
**Week 3**: "Surprising pattern: Model X excels at crypto, Model Y crushes politics"
**Week 4**: "One month in: Early leaderboard and lessons learned"
**Month 2**: "Cohort 1 complete - full results and what they mean for AI evaluation"

**Notes:**
- Update GitHub URL with your actual repository
- Consider adding your email or contact method if seeking collaborations
- The "no resolutions yet" framing positions this as a live experiment worth following
- Emphasizes transparency and real-time nature (not cherry-picked results)
